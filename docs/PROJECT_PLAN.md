# MineCraft Clone — Project Plan

> **Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 4 + Three.js
> **Target**: Desktop Chrome/Firefox, 60fps with 12-chunk render distance
> **Node**: 16+ compatible (uses Vite 4)

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 — Core Engine | **DONE** | Chunk system, player controls, block interaction |
| 2 — World Gen | **DONE** | Simplex noise terrain, 6 biomes, caves, trees, ores |
| 3 — Game Systems | **DONE** | Inventory, crafting, furnace, survival, save/load |
| 4 — Content | NOT STARTED | Mobs, day/night, fluids, redstone, Nether/End |

---

## Phase 1 — Core Engine (Current)

**Goal**: Walk around a flat/blocky world, place and break blocks.

### Deliverables
- [x] Vite + React + Three.js project scaffold
- [x] Chunk-based voxel renderer (16×256×16 chunks)
- [x] Face-culling mesh optimization
- [x] First-person camera + pointer lock
- [x] WASD movement, jumping, gravity, AABB collision
- [x] Block breaking (left click) and placement (right click) via raycasting
- [x] Hotbar UI (9 slots, scroll wheel selection)
- [x] 30 block types (stone, grass, dirt, ores, wood, leaves, sand, water, etc.)
- [x] Procedural texture atlas (no external files needed)
- [x] 6 biomes (Plains, Desert, Mountains, Forest, Snow, Ocean)
- [x] Cave generation with 3D noise
- [x] Tree generation per biome
- [x] Ore distribution (coal, iron, gold, diamond)
- [x] Debug overlay (F3)
- [x] Fly mode (F key)
- [x] Day/night cycle (background color)
- [x] Build verified (tsc + vite build pass)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Render distance of 8+ chunks without frame drops
- Player can walk, jump, fall, collide with terrain
- Blocks can be placed and broken in real-time
- Hotbar displays selected block

## Phase 2 — World Generation

**Goal**: Infinite procedural terrain with varied biomes.

### Deliverables
- [ ] 2D/3D Simplex noise terrain generation
- [ ] Biome system (plains, desert, mountains, forest, ocean, snow)
- [ ] Cave generation (3D noise carving)
- [ ] Tree generation (oak, birch, spruce, jungle)
- [ ] Ore distribution (coal, iron, gold, diamond, redstone, lapis)
- [ ] Water bodies at sea level
- [ ] Chunk loading/unloading with distance-based priority

### Acceptance Criteria
- World generates seamlessly as player walks
- Biome transitions are smooth
- Caves are explorable and lit
- Trees spawn in appropriate biomes

---

## Phase 3 — Game Systems

**Goal**: Full inventory, crafting, and survival mechanics.

### Deliverables
- [x] 36-slot inventory (27 main + 9 hotbar)
- [x] Crafting grid (3×3) with recipe matching
- [x] Furnace with smelting recipes
- [x] Crafting recipes (tools, armor, blocks, materials)
- [x] Health and hunger bars (UI display + game logic)
- [x] Fall damage, drowning, starvation
- [x] Tool system (5 materials × 4 tools = 20 tools)
- [x] Item drops when blocks break
- [x] Armor system (iron + diamond, 4 slots)
- [x] Food system (apple, bread, steak, porkchop)
- [x] IndexedDB save/load system (auto-save every 60s)
- [x] E key opens inventory UI
- [x] Number keys 1-9 for hotbar selection

### Acceptance Criteria
- Player can craft all basic tools and items
- Furnace smelts ores into ingots
- Health/hunger system works
- Game state persists across sessions

---

## Phase 4 — Content Expansion

**Goal**: Add life, danger, and advanced mechanics.

### Deliverables
- [x] Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting (sun/moon positions, ambient color)
- [x] Hostile mobs (zombie, skeleton, creeper, spider)
- [x] Passive mobs (cow, pig, sheep, chicken)
- [x] Mob spawning by light level + time of day
- [x] Mob AI: chase (hostile), wander (passive), jump over obstacles
- [x] Combat system with sword damage + knockback
- [x] Water and lava fluid simulation (flow + water+lava=cobblestone)
- [x] Particle effects (block break, damage, mob death)
- [x] Mob drops on death
- [x] Redstone system (wire BFS propagation, torch, repeater, piston, lever)
- [x] Nether dimension generator (caves, lava lakes, glowstone)
- [x] Portal frame detection (4×5 obsidian) + activation
- [x] Sound effects (procedural Web Audio: break/place/hurt/mob/explosion/lightning)
- [x] Weather system (rain particles, thunder + lightning flash)
- [ ] End portal and Ender Dragon
- [ ] Ambient music

## Key Constants

```
CHUNK_SIZE = 16 (width) × 256 (height) × 16 (depth)
BLOCK_SIZE = 1 (unit)
RENDER_DISTANCE = 8 chunks
SEA_LEVEL = 62
WORLD_HEIGHT = 256
TICK_RATE = 20 ticks/second
```

## How to Continue Development

1. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details
2. Check `src/constants.ts` for game constants
3. Each module is self-contained — read the file header for its purpose
4. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
5. Run `npm run build` to verify no TypeScript errors
